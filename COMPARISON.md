# Visual Comparison: Before vs After

## Test Case: 5 Text Boxes Layout

### HTML Original (Expected Output)
- 5 text boxes with equal height
- Each box has a different colored border (red, blue, green, orange, purple)
- Boxes span almost the full width with proper margins
- Rounded corners on all boxes
- Text is centered and clearly visible (24px)
- Even spacing between boxes (20px gap)

### PPTX Before Fix
❌ **Major Issues:**
- Text boxes were extremely thin vertically
- Text was too small to read properly
- Height calculation was incorrect for `flex: 1` items

✅ **Working Elements:**
- Border colors were correct
- Rounded corners were present
- Width spanning was correct
- Spacing between boxes was reasonable

### PPTX After Fix
✅ **All Issues Resolved:**
- Text boxes now have proper height (equal distribution of vertical space)
- Text is clearly visible at the correct size
- Layout matches the HTML rendering
- All styling is preserved correctly

## Key Measurements

| Measurement | HTML | Before Fix | After Fix |
|------------|------|------------|-----------|
| Box Height | ~106px each | ~15px each | ~106px each ✅ |
| Box Width | ~1200px | ~1200px | ~1200px ✅ |
| Vertical Spacing | 20px | 20px | 20px ✅ |
| Border Radius | 8px | 8px | 8px ✅ |
| Text Size | 24px | Too small | 24px ✅ |

## Technical Root Cause

The issue was in the `calculateElementPosition` function:

**Before:** Elements with `flex: 1` were falling back to a default height calculation based on line height, which resulted in very small heights (~15px).

**After:** Elements with `flex: 1` now properly calculate their height by:
1. Counting the number of flex items
2. Getting the parent container height
3. Subtracting padding and gaps
4. Dividing the available space equally among flex items

This ensures that flexbox layouts are accurately converted from HTML to PowerPoint.
